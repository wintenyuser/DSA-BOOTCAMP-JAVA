# DSA-BOOTCAMP-JAVA

Static vs Dynamic Languages:

**Static Languages**
-> Perform Type Checking at compile time
-> Errors will show at compile time
-> Declare datatype before you use it
-> More Control

**Dynamic Language**
-> Perform type checking at runtime
-> Error might not show till program is run
-> No need to declare datatypes of variables
->Saves time in writing code but might give runtime error

**Memory Management**
->Stack Memory and Heap Memory
a = 10
a-- ref variable
10 -- object

a-- stored in stack
10-- stored in heap

a is pointing towards address of 10
**a=10**

-> **More than 1 reference variable can point to one object**
-> **If any one of these variables change the object original object will be changed and it is going to be changed for all**

**No Reference Variable to the object**
