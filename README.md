Static vs Dynamic Languages:

**Static Languages**
-> Perform Type Checking at compile time
-> Errors will show at compile time
-> Declare datatype before you use it
-> More Control

**Dynamic Language**
-> Perform type checking at runtime
-> Error might not show till program is run
-> No need to declare datatypes of variables
->Saves time in writing code but might give runtime error

**Memory Management**
